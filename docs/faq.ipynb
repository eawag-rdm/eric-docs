    "A DOI (Digital Object Identifier) is a string of characters, such as `10.25678/000066`, that is registered in a global registry and associated with a URL, such as `https://doi.org/10.25678/000066`, that redirects to the location of the document, dataset or its landing page.\n",
    "\n",
    "DOIs are also associated with metadata (pretty much everything that you submit when you create a *data package* in ERIC), which feeds into global search services, such as [search.datacite.org](https://search.datacite.org/works?query=Eawag) or [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch/search?query=Eawag), making your work more visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "DOIs exist in two states, **draft** and **published**. A draft DOI is not yet publicly available, which means that the data it is reserved for can still be modified. Once a DOI has been published, the data it refers to can no longer be modified. At this point the data is **immutable**.\n",
