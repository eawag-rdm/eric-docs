    "\n",
    "This is guide should help to organize and annotate research data to\n",
    "make it suitable for the deposition in the Eawag Research Data\n",
    "Institutional Archive [ERIC](https://data.eawag.ch) (*{octicon}`alert-fill;1em;sd-text-danger` only accessible from Eawag intranet*)\n",
    "or other repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a good research data package is most efficiently created from\n",
    "data that has been well managed throughout the research process, we\n",
    "also provide some relevant advice for good data management practices\n",
    "well before the final package for archiving is prepared. As a\n",
    "side-effect, considering these guidelines might therefore also improve\n",
    "the efficiency of your work.\n",

    "## Scope of *research data*\n",
    "\n",
    "The term *research data* here refers not only to numerical datasets\n",
    "proper, but to all kinds of information that can be used to reproduce,\n",
    "validate, or re-use scientific a work. If that work is the subject of\n",
    "a published article or report, we used the term *publication data\n",
    "package* to refer to the data associated with the publication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary data\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, *primary data* is digital data that is the direct,\n",
    "unmodified result of observations, measurements, surveys, etc. In\n",
    "practice however, a modified form of that data, e.g. through\n",
    "format conversions or the discarding of irrelevant data, is frequently\n",
    "considered *primary data*. As a rule of thumb, *primary data* is data\n",
    "for which there exists no previous incarnation that cannot be\n",
    "deleted. The researcher, considering conventions in her or his field,\n",
    "defines what exactly to archive as *primary data*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Archiving **primary data** is of the essence.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Derived data\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the *primary data*, you should include as a minimum for\n",
    "a *publication data package* all datasets necessary to reproduce the\n",
    "figures, tables and individual numbers in the running text that are\n",
    "presented in the main paper and the Supporting Information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider including more. Providing additionally data from intermediate\n",
    "steps in the chain of analysis and related but not crucial data for\n",
    "the publication in question will make your data package more useful\n",
    "and increase your work’s credibility and exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Third party data\n",
    "\n",
    "Third party data is data that was used for the research but was not\n",
    "gathered within the frame of the respective research project. It is\n",
    "important to properly document the provenance of this data and be\n",
    "aware whether there are restrictions to publish it outside (or even\n",
    "inside) Eawag. In case there are legal problems regarding the\n",
    "archiving and/or publishing of such data, please contact\n",
    "[rdm@eawag.ch](mailto:rdm@eawag.ch).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source code\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer code is often a critical part of the research and necessary\n",
    "to validate or reproduce the work. You should include any code along\n",
    "with relevant information about dependencies, the platform(s) it runs\n",
    "on, required interpreters, compilers, libraries and the\n",
    "versions used. Take care to provide a reasonable degree of user\n",
    "documentation for your software.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Python code we recommend that you use virtual environments to\n",
    "encapsulate dependencies\n",
    "([`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) for Python 2 or\n",
    "[`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for Python 3)\n",
    "and create installable modules including `setup.py` and\n",
    "`requirements.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For R, there is the dependency management system\n",
    "[Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) that serves the same\n",
    "purpose. A more recent package,\n",
    "[renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html), aims to\n",
    "replace Packrat in a robust and stable fashion \"with fewer surprises\n",
    "and better default behavior\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, get acquainted with and use the package/dependency\n",
    "management system of your language of choice and start using it to\n",
    "allow users of your code a simple installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Version control systems\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good practice to use source code versioning systems such as\n",
    "[Git](https://git-scm.com/) and often a copy of the code is kept on a\n",
    "collaboration platform such as\n",
    "[gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in) or\n",
    "[github.com](https://github.com). <mark>Do not just refer to such a\n",
    "platform when archiving your code</mark>, as they do not qualify as\n",
    "\"archives\" and might disappear tomorrow. Instead, create a `zip`- or\n",
    "`tar`-archive from the version of the source code used in your work\n",
    "and add it to the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reproducible computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken seriously, providing the software infrastructure for other\n",
    "researchers to reliably run your code in the future can be very\n",
    "difficult for non-trivial codebases and no generally applicable\n",
    "recommendations currently exist. Most proposals involve virtual\n",
    "machines (VMs) or container technologies such as\n",
    "[LXC/LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/), Docker,\n",
    "[rkt](https://coreos.com/rkt/) or\n",
    "[Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/). [ReproZip](https://www.reprozip.org)\n",
    "is a promising tool to collect the dependencies of your code into a\n",
    "container- or VM-format. If you are facing that challenge, please get\n",
    "in touch with [rdm@eawag.ch](mailto:rdm@eawag.ch).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Third party code\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to third party data, third party code should be included in the data package if you can't refer to a copy of\n",
    "exactly the version you used, which is available from a reliable,\n",
    "well-established repository committed to long-term preservation. For\n",
    "example, you don't have to archive R version 3.4.4 - the\n",
    "[The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html)\n",
    "will [do that](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/) most reliably\n",
    "for you. However, if you used\n",
    "[this R package for extreme value analysis](https://github.com/C2SM/gevXgpd),\n",
    "which seems to be only available from a single GitHub repository, by\n",
    "all means archive it yourself. Also for third party-code, make sure\n",
    "that all dependencies (including versions) are provided\n",
    "explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proprietary software\n",
    "\n",
    "These recommendations might not be workable in full if you used\n",
    "proprietary third party software, libraries, languages or\n",
    "tool-chains. <mark>Aim at using exclusively open source software for\n",
    "scientific work</mark>, since proprietary tools diminish the credibility,\n",
    "reproducibility and long-term value of your research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ancillary information\n",
    "\n",
    "Generously add any files and information that could further help to\n",
    "understand your work or build on your results. This includes for\n",
    "example photos and figures of a related publication and its Supporting\n",
    "Information , maps, pointers to related resources such as the project\n",

    "\n",
    "**Throughout the project**, keep your research data continuously\n",
    "reasonably organized from the start. Experienced researchers usually\n",
    "do that already. If you come back after three weeks of holidays and\n",

    "what it means, you are OK. If you organize your data in a\n",
    "[directory hierarchy](folder-structure-and-file-archives) and/or\n",
    "employ a [file naming convention](file-naming), put some effort into\n",

    "your project develops and these conventions and structures don't match\n",
    "anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary data** should be archived as soon as possible so safeguard\n",

    "available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leaving researchers** should be reminded early to prepare and archive\n",
